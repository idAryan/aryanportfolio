                "A innovative project, In which a user can use mobile flash signals to convert the written text into
                morse code and then flash light with temporal constraints. After that the receiver decodes the messege received via flash signals through
                by detecting flash signals via converting the image to various Image processing techniques
                and detected the flash light through thresholding and Contours. In last applied Aspect Ratio filtering
                on bounding box and flash signal record timing is noted via python library time. After that it maps to the morse to letter hashmap and output is displayed.  "
